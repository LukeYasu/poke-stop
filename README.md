# Poke Stop

A mock e-commerce site for Pokémon trainers who want want to purchase items for their Pokémon

I wanted to do this project because I wanted to create a full stack application that can display products in a meaningful and effective way to customers by providing them with many options and information about the product when you first open the page. I wanted to replicate something similar to a real e-commerce site as they also provide you with lots of information up front.
